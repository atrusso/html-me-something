                    Greetings fellow travelers! I hope we find you in great spirits this lovely day. If you've found this
                    scroll then you have started your first step into the boundless adventures that are sure to follow. 
                    Only the most daring of individuals should continue reading beyond this point as mysteries, intrigue, 
                    and thrills will be around every corner...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay, switching to the regular talk for a minute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For years I have been interested in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), but always found a reason to never jump in.
                    A few years back my wife's cousin asked me to sit in a few games and I loved it. Everything from the 
                    character creation to the roleplaying and combat peaked my interests. I started to look into it more and more.
                    After several days of browsing through forums like reddit and rpg.stackexchange I came across several podcasts 
                    and youtube channels that ran campaigns. I started listening/watching them and fell in love even more. 
                    I knew several people from work who were interested or would be if I invited them so I figured I'd spend some 
                    $$$ and buy the starting materials I needed. After spending a few weeks reading the appropriate Dungeon Master (DM) 
                    materials I felt in pretty good shape to approach the people I wanted to participate in my campaign. Once we started 
                    it was bumpy at first as this was entirely new to me, but I stuck with it and ended up getting really good at making 
                    shit up on the spot because <em>Rule #1 - nothing will ever go as expected.</em> Anyways the more sessions we had, the more found 
                    I had and I could tell my players were having fun as well. So if you're interested in D&D please read on 
                    (if you don't mind spoilers), I broke it down into quick narrated version of my notes after we completed each 
                    session. Hopefully I can motivate some of you to check it out at!

                <p>
                    The story starts with our adventures in a wagon headed out of the town of Neverwinter. It is a nice semi-cloudy day in the
                    tail-end of the summer season. Some of the characters know one another, but others do not so they all take the time to introduce
                    themselves. The protagonists of this adventure are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Varo the Bard (Drow - aka Dark Elf)</li>
                        <li>Yalith the Paladin (Tiefling)</li>
                        <li>Dohmnall the Fighter (Human)</li>
                        <li>Todaflink the Sorcerer (Rock Gnome)</li>
                        <li>Falcar the Warlock (Human)</li>
                        <li>Feora the Cleric (Hill Dwarf)</li>
                    </ul>
                    The adventures were recruited by an acquaintance, Gundren Rockseeker, to help deliver a wagon full of goods to a nearby 
                    town of Phandalin with the promise of 10g a piece upon delivery. Gundren left the night before in another wagon, but a guide from 
                    Phandalin, Orel Kosef, was told by Gundren to help get them there. The wagon was full general supplies: tools (pickaxes, shovels, crowbars, etc), 
                    sacks flour/wheat, barrels of ale, casks of salted pork, etc. Before the adventures reached Phandalin, they come across a raided/looted wagon 
                    in the road with no survivors in sight. They are ambushed by goblins, while chasing one of them, they are led back to a cave - 
                    Cragmaw Cave where they defeated a number of goblins and a bugbear named Klarg and his pet wolf Ripper. Dohmnall almost died at the jaws of Ripper.
                    They let the 2nd in command, Yeemik, go in exchange for the life of Sildar Hallwinter (Gundren’s escort). They discover all of Gundren’s supplies 
                    and additional supplies marked for Lionshield Coster in Phandalin. After rescuing Sildar, he tells them what he knows. Gundren, most likely, 
                    has been taken to Cragmaw Castle along with his secret map. Klarg was tipped off about Gundren by someone or something known as the Black Spider. 
                    Gundren and his two brothers (Tharden & Nundro) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave (the map shows entrance). 
                    The site is in the mines of the Phandelver’s Pact, which is a long lost mine. Story says more than five hundred years ago, 
                    clans of dwarves and gnomes made and agreement (The Phandevler’s Pact). They were to share the riches of the mine (ore & magical forge of spells). 
                    Humans joined in too. Eventually powerful wizards & orcs raided and destroyed much of the mines. They were lost for a very long time. 
                    Sildar agreed to go to Phandalin because he was looking for a wizard from his order (Lords’ Alliance). The wizard (Iarno Albrek) hasn’t 
                    been heard from in two months. Sildar promises to pay 50 gold if the adventures help escort him to Phandalin. He has no money, 
                    but assures them he can get a loan within a day (perk of being in the Lords’ Alliance)

                    The adventures make it to Phandalin, and drop off the goods at Barthen’s Provisions. After telling Elmer (store owner) 
                    about Gundren he urges them to find him. The group choose not to collect on the 10gp a piece promised price until Gundren is returned. 
                    In return Elmer has wrote a note to get the adventures deals on weapons/armor and potions from other vendors/people from around town. 
                    Elmer also warns of the Redband Gang in town and how they are dangerous and causing problems. In no particular order, they 
                    meet the following people in town:

                    Yalith goes to Sleeping Giant by herself, ends up talking herself into some trouble with four Redbands. They take her semi-hostage and go to Stonehill Inn with her. 
                    The group attacks and kills the four ruffians. They learn the leader is the Glasstaff, the hideout is the Tresendar Manor. Yalith uncovers a crumbled up piece of 
                    paper that has some scribbled writing on it reading “illefarn” in one of the Redband’s pockets. The group take all 4 red cloaks incase they need for later. While 
                    town slept, Varo did some sneaking around trying to acquire more information. Varo visited the Miner’s Exchange Guild, that’s as much as the rest of the group knows. 
                    Town super excited that the adventures dealt with part of the Redband Gang. Feora and Todaflink convince Daran Edermeath to rally a small force to help deal with the Redband Gang. 
                    Daran puts on his glorious/gleaming armor from the time he spent as a Marshal in the Order of the Gauntlet and marches to town hall and pleads with the mayor. The mayor agrees to authorize a 
                    militia/force. The group is able to gather four fully (heavily) armored men from Linene Graywind. Additionally, she allows the group to use (temporarily) the finest quality goods she has, 
                    at the mayor’s request. Any non-magical weapon has +2 dmg for the upcoming fight against the Redbands. Qelline gives the group several healing potions and two vials filled with “acid-like” 
                    substance. With the +2 dmg weapons, Daran Edermeath, 4 heavily armored smithies, and the one-and-only Orel Kosef, the adventures prepare an assault on the Redband Stronghold/Lair of 
                    Tresendar Manor. Orel has been “trained/guided/influenced” by Yalith (teaching 2h), Varo (teaching daggers), and Feora (shield/1h). Group agrees that they will split up for 
                    assault. Main fighting force will go in through the front while a smaller more stealthy group (using the red cloaks they acquired earlier) go through the tunnel that Carp found.

                    The two groups assault Tresendar Manor. Main group ends up finding and freeing a group of prisoners. Of them, Mirna Drendar says she cannot pay the group, but tells them 
                    of her family’s shop at Thundertree. Within the shop there is an emerald necklace that is quite valuable under a storage shelf. Stealth group ends up being the opposite of stealthy, 
                    and stumbles their way through the dungeon barely escaping critical situations involving being outnumbered by multiple bug bears, a strange pyschic one-eyed creature, and about a half dozen ruffians. 
                    The groups eventually meet up and save the stealth group moments before they meet there demise. In what can only be described as battle of the bastards-ish. A massive fire is started after 
                    the stealth group starts a fire underground as a distraction. An incredibly large force (basically the whole damn dungeon) comes to a point where about a dozen men, 4 bugbears, and even 
                    the one-eyed creature (a Nothic) end up crashing down on the party. Bodies keep piling up, the smell of burned flesh and the sounds of screaming scare everyone to the core. The group 
                    somehow makes it out of it with the most absurb manuever ever. Dohmnall (fighter) throws Todaflink (sorcerer) through the air above the large force and proceeds to cast an 
                    incredibly deafening Thunderclap spell that kills several outright and knocks many to the ground. Dohmnall, continues to be his risky self and nearly gets killed 
                    yet again. The group somehow manage to life, and defeat the bulk of the forces. Basically everyone who tried to kill them dies, some through weapons, others through fire, and 
                    even some through the vicous Nothic creature as it clawed and devoured them. The fighting frightens many of them and they will forever be haunted by the sights they saw 
                    that day. The burning bodies, the chocking smoke, the blood and moaning all over the place, and the animated corpses guarding the crypt...which they decided to have this fight in. Luckily, 
                    Yalith thought on her toes and pulled out the crumbled paper and spoke the Tresendar family motto “illefarn” which turned the animated undead into docile guards that allowed them to leave 
                    with their lives. For his incredibly stupid fighting and decision making, Dohmnall somehow stumbled across a beautiful sword belonging the to Tresendar family bloodline. The group ends up searching 
                    the whole manner and can find no sign of Glasstaff. The next day, the group finds a note from Feora stating she felt a magical urgency that she was desparately needed by her 
                    family and she was leaving the group.

                    The group carries out several of the smaller quests for the town that various characters mentioned. Including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Finding the Banshee (Agatha), playing to her vanity and getting a little of information about the spellbook. It was given some hundred years ago to a 
                        Necromancer in a far off land. The group left disappointed, but chose not to push a Banshee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The group next went to Old Owl Well and quickly killed off the young Necromancer and his minions. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The raiding orcs in the Wyvern Tor were easily dispatched with some smart think on Varo's part and a well timed, Fireball from Todaflink.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The group journeys back to Phandalin and lets the Magistrate know they took care of the orcs and request the bounty they were promisde. 
                    He gladly pays, they also go to the other people of the town and let them know that their other issues are resolved. For all the help with the town, the Magistrate offers the group Tresendar Manor. 
                    The town agrees to help the adventures rebuild the Manor to the former glory and more. The local smithies and a few others with building experience estimate 
                    the total costs to be somewhere around 10,000 gold. The town will handle half of it through the profits of the mining, this will be a multi-year process. The group 
                    works with Daran to start a town guard and have about 15 men that start training. The purpose of this the town guard is multi purposed, but the main reasons were 
                    for the town for feel safe, to boost moral, and also to help ensure an issue like the Redband gang never happens again. Yalith agrees to help train and coordinate 
                    with Daran.

                <p>
                    The group heads to the Thundertree ruins. Almost immediately after entering the outskirts of town, they meet Reidoth (the druid). Reidoth tells 
                    them about the unnatural and dangerous plants, undead, a cult of dragon worshipers who are preparing to meet with...a dragon! The group decides to burn the 
                    plant overgrowth of the edges of town while keeping an ever watchful eye out for the dragon (have not seen or heard yet). They destroy any undead within the town, 
                    which happened to include some giant spiders. Eventually, the group runs across the dragon cult. They have a tense negotation, but eventually all agree to go 
                    meet the dragon and try and treat with him. Upon making to the dragon's tower and seeing the size of him, the cultist realize this dragon is not willing to treat with humans 
                    so they (speaking draconic, none of the adventurers can understant) offer to be the dragons servants if he kills the group. The dragon laughs at them 
                    and attacks. The main cultist happened to be a very powerful practicioner of magic and was able to hex the dragon into being rather ineffective. The group is somehow able 
                    to defeat the dragon (miraculously...DM NOTE: they were not supposed to kill the dragon or live if they tried to fight the dragon to the death). The main cultist 
                    ends up dying due to exhaustion. Whatever cultists still lived decided to flee and hide. Reidoth being a individual entuned with nature, was exstatic that 
                    the group was able to kill the undead, deal with the dragon and not destroy all the forestry of the area while getting rid of the strange attacking plants. 
                    He decides to tell the group the locations of both the Wave Echo Cave and Cragmaw Castle.
